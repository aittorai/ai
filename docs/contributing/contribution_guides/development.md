# Development

## **What do I need to know to help?**

If you are looking to help with a code contribution, AI uses several different technologies under the hood: Python (Pydantic, FastAPI, diffusers) and Typescript (React, Redux Toolkit, ChakraUI, Mantine, Konva). Familiarity with StableDiffusion and image generation concepts is helpful, but not essential. 


## **Get Started**

To get started, take a look at our [new contributors checklist](newContributorChecklist.md)

Once you're setup, for more information, you can review the documentation specific to your area of interest:



## Best Practices: 
* Keep your pull requests small. Smaller pull requests are more likely to be accepted and merged
* Comments! Commenting your code helps reviewers easily understand your contribution
* Use Python and Typescriptâ€™s typing systems, and consider using an editor with [LSP](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) support to streamline development
* Make all communications public. This ensure knowledge is shared with the whole community
