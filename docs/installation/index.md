## Automated Installer & Updates

✅ The automated [installer](./installer.md) is the best way to install Aittor.

⬆️ The same installer is also the best way to update Aittor - simply rerun it for the same folder you installed to.

The installation process simply manages installation for the core libraries & application dependencies that run Aittor.

Models, images, or other assets in the Aittor root folder won't be affected by the installation process.

## Manual Install

If you are familiar with python and want more control over the packages that are installed, you can [install Aittor manually via PyPI](./manual.md).

Updates are managed by reinstalling the latest version through PyPi.

## Developer Install

If you want to contribute to the app, you'll need to set up a [dev environment](../contributing/dev-environment.md).

## Docker

Aittor publishes docker images. See the [docker installation guide](./docker.md) for details.
